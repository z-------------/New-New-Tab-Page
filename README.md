## Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests or issues of any kind.

Help with updating and completing the existing translations or starting new ones (in the `locales` directory) would also be greatly appreciated -- `bin/localesHelper.js` could be helpful for this.

It would be good if contributed code passes `eslint`ing, but it's not a requirement.

## To-do

These are a couple of features and improvements I'm hoping to include in the nearish future:

* Less hacky handling of bottom-right drawers
* Ability to use local file for shortcut icons
* Preview blur effect in options
