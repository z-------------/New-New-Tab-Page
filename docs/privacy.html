    <p>If the option to use GPS for weather location is not enabled, New New Tab Page's server side sends the IP address from which the request was sent to a service provided by <a href="https://ipinfo.io/" target="_blank">ipinfo.io</a> in order to estimate the user's location; this estimate is then transmitted to another service as outlined below. The transmission of the user's IP address can be prevented by disabling the Sidebar feature or by enabling the GPS feature.</p>
    <p>If the option to use GPS for weather location is enabled, New New Tab Page's server side attempts to use the GNSS capabilities of the user's computer to determine the user's location; this is then sent via New New Tab Page's server side to another service as outlined below. The retrieval and transmission of the user's location can be prevented by disabling the Sidebar feature or by disabling the GPS feature.</p>
    <p>Once the user's location has been estimated or determined by the above means, New New Tab Page's server side transmits it to a service provided by <a href="https://darksky.net" target="_blank">Dark Sky</a> to retrieve the relevant weather conditions.</p>
